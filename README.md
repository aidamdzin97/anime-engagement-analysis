# Anime Engagement Analysis

## Overview
This project was developed during the **Khazanah Youth Development Program (KYD)** short course as part of my capstone project.  
The main goal is to analyze **user engagement trends in anime** using a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dbdmobile/myanimelist-dataset).  
The analysis covers how anime engagement has evolved over time, which genres have dominated, and how users rate and complete anime.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [MyAnimeList Dataset – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dbdmobile/myanimelist-dataset)  
- **Files Used:** Anime information, user details, and user ratings.  
- **Size:** ~6 CSV files (cleaned and joined into final datasets for analysis).  

## Methods
The following steps were performed:
1. **Data Collection** – Downloaded raw datasets from Kaggle.  
2. **Data Cleaning** – Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized formats.  
3. **Data Transformation** – Created new columns and joined multiple datasets.  
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Investigated user engagement patterns with visualizations.  
5. **Visualization** – Built graphs (histograms, line charts, bar plots) to highlight trends.  

## Research Questions
- How has user engagement with anime evolved over time?  
- Which anime genres have dominated different periods, and how have their popularity trends shifted?  
- Do users tend to complete more anime over time, and are there differences by release year?  
- What is the current status distribution of anime?  
- What is the overall distribution of user ratings for anime?  

## Key Findings
- **User Engagement Over Time:** Engagement has grown steadily, with spikes during years when popular titles were released.  
- **Genre Popularity:** Shounen and Action dominated earlier years, while Slice of Life and Romance gained popularity more recently.  
- **Completion Trends:** Users are more likely to complete newer anime, possibly due to shorter series formats and binge-watching habits.  
- **Anime Status Distribution:** Most titles are "Finished Airing," with fewer "Currently Airing" and "Not Yet Aired" anime.  
- **User Ratings:** Ratings are skewed positively, with the majority of users giving scores between 7–9 out of 10.  

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization  
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis
